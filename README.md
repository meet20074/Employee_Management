The Employee Management System is a web application built using React, HTML, Tailwind CSS, and local storage. This project allows users to manage employee information such as adding, updating, and deleting employee records. It leverages local storage to persist data, ensuring that the data remains available even after page reloads. The user interface is styled with Tailwind CSS for a responsive, clean design, and React provides the interactivity and dynamic functionality needed for managing the employee details.

Key Features:

Add, edit, and delete employee records.
Store data persistently in the browser's local storage.
Responsive and clean design using Tailwind CSS.
Built with React for dynamic updates without needing to refresh the page.

This system can be expanded with backend integration in the future, but for now, it demonstrates a lightweight, client-side solution for managing employee information.
